# WeeklyChallenge - Readme

## Project Description

WeeklyChallenge is a collaborative project developed in partnership with [Gerassu](https://github.com/Gerassu). The main goal of the project is to create mini-projects using randomly selected programming languages and topics.

## How It Works

Every week, we would spin a wheel to randomly select a programming language and a topic. The selected programming language would determine the language in which the mini-project had to be implemented, while the chosen topic would provide the context or theme for the project.

### First Week - Java Swing & Confetti

The main objective of this project is to create a visually appealing confetti animation using Java Swing. The confetti will be displayed on a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Swing components. The animation will involve random movement, colors, and shapes to simulate falling confetti.

### Second Week - Python RPG from CMD & Cyber Apocalyptic World

The objective of this project is to create an immersive role-playing game (RPG) experience within a cyber-apocalyptic world. The game will be played through the command-line interface, where players will navigate through a dystopian landscape, interact with characters, complete quests, and engage in turn-based combat.

## Project Suspension

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, the project is currently suspended.
