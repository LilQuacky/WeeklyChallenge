About Game Jam Themed Project against [Gerassu](https://github.com/Gerassu)

Spinning a wheel we choose the programming language and the themes on which the project will focus.
We have a week to create the project.

DISCLAIMER: It's just for fun, any position taken in the project is for play purposes only.
